kote (koh·teh) is a tiny kernel made from scratch. At ~5kLOC it is capable of
preemptive multitasking, userspace with 2 syscalls and a framebuffer console.

It should be portable to something other than x86-64 and is made to be
as minimal and readable as possible. It also has no cargo dependencies.

Building:

    sudo apt install …
        nasm
        gcc             # or clang
        texinfo         # makeinfo
        xorriso         # for ISOs
        qemu-system-x86 # optional

    make toolchain

    make
